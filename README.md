Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a mechanism that makes it possible to address, 
access and manipulate objects without having to consider how those objects relate to their data sources.

This is (basic) ORM implementaion using Java Refleflection API.\n
On startup it will create table with fields specified in model (models.User.java).
Application allows to save, update and find users in database using Java class methods.
(SQL queries will be generated automatically).

Testing of application is in app.Program.java
